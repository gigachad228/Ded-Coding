1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
 1d. Using the work from this repository in artificial intelligence or large language models is a dick move unless you contact the author of this repository at "FutaCockSlugger@cumallover.me". Not following this instance is what a dick would do.
 1e. Modifying the original work, related works/services, works based on this work and making it closed source, instant dick move

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's creator a non-alcoholic beverage.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
