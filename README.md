my LUA projects
for proton.lua you need to make a config file $HOME/.config/dedproton/default.cfg
first line is for values "y" and "n" and they correspond to defaulting proton, set it to "n" if you don't want your proton to be chosed automatically by yourself
second line is a number for proton, 1 for proton-cachyos and 2 for proton-GE-custom
the config file should look like this:
```
y
2
```
